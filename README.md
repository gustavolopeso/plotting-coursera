### Assignment 4 - Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

In this assignment, I had to create a question to answer using two different datasets from the web. I chose to answer a question about public libraries and book colections from **São Paulo**, the capital city of the state of São Paulo.

I used some pandas to load and treat the data that I took from [São Paulo Urban Planning and Licensing website](https://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/licenciamento/), some pyplot to create a visualization of the data, and some numpy to help with the analysis.

Loading, merging, pre-analysing, removing outliers, analysing the data and discussing the results are the steps shown in this notebook.

The data can be found in the /data repo, but I needed to access it through requests to load them at coursera environment.

Hope you like it! :)
